/* I know that I have more questions but I cant think of how to word them in a way that would be

// DOCUMENTATION

// 1. Description: I do not understand how convert a type into another type using a constructor\
which is hindering my finishing of many of the problems because it is causing errors that i do not\
know how to fix.\
	Name:  Query the strings length, returning an integer

// 2. Description: I do not know how to properly use and call a header file within a class. I also dont\
know how to identify where stuff inside the header file goes.\
	Name:  A .h and .cpp file submitted that implements the defined String class as per the\
specifications in Part 1 of the Assessment Description above, following industry-standard coding techniques

// 3. Description: I do not know how to make a comparison of two strings to see if they are the same.\
	Name:  The ability to compare if the string is the same as another string class

// 4. Descripton: I do not know how to setup a function that will make an append to a string,\
 as in I dont know how to begin the set up of how to do it.\
	Name:  The ability to append one string to another

// 5. Description: I dont know how to set up a function that will prepend a string to another.\
	Name:  The ability to prepend one string to another

// 6,7,8. Description: I do not know what a substring is exactly. Like what is the definition of a\
substring and what does it do? how do you use it?\
  6 Name:	The ability to find a sub-string within the string class\
  7 Name:	The ability to find a sub-string within the string class, \
starting from a certain index within the string\
  8 Name: The ability to replace a sub-string found within the string with a different sub-string\

// 9,10. Desctiption: I do not understand what "constant C-style" and "const char" mean. I understand that\
char is a variable type but what does "const" do to it?\
  9 Name:	The ability to return the string as a basic constant C-style string (const char*)\
 10 Name:	The ability to set the string to an input C-style string

// 11,12. Description: I do not understand how to make the strings characters uppercase/lowercase.\
I do know that i need to use a loop to make the duplicates.\
 11 Name:	The ability to convert the string to a duplicate containing all uppercase letters\
 12 Name:	The ability to convert the string to a duplicate containing all lowercase letters\
